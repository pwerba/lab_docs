# Lim Lab Server Resources

The Lim lab has a server called "casalim" this server is located in one of the server rooms here at Mission bay and provides redundant, reliable network storage for lab research data.

The server capacity is about 50TB and currently contains the data the lab has collected over the last few years. We just upgraded the server to this amount of storage to fit the needs of the lab.

Currently the server is setup running open source software connected to a very large array of disks running the ZFS file system.

The server is setup so that each lab member gets a home folder that is only accessible to that lab member. As well as a folder called "limshared" that has shared files and folders for anyone to access. It is important to not that that folder is "read-writable" to all members of the lab so take care when making changes to that folder.

Please contact (me) Peter Werba if you need any custom folders or permissions I am happy to work with you to make sure that the server is helping you with your research.
